## Implementation
- 100% Programatic UI (No Storyboard)
- MVC Design Pattern

### Frameworks
- UIKit
- TMDB API
- URLSession
- Core Data
- Foundation
    - NSCache

### What I learned:
- Writing the AutoLayout programatically can be quite the hassle compared to using AutoLayout with Storyboards
- I had great practice with more UIKit fundamentals such as CollectionViews and TableViews
- Networking practices using the URLSession framework to fetch and make download tasks from REST APIs
- The importance of making asynchronous task downloads using GCD, which is essential to creating fast and responsive mobile applications
- More practice with CoreData persistent storage: storing, fetching, and deleting records
