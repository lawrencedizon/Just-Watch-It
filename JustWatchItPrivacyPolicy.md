# Privacy Policy

Lawrence Dizon built the JustWatchIt app as a free app. This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the JustWatchIt application.

## Information Collection and Use

While using the JustWatchIt app, no personally identifiable or contact information will be collected. The app will never ask for your name, email, or location.


## Links to Other Sites

The JustWatchIt app may contain links to other sites. The service behind the movie content information utilizes the The Movie Database API. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of their provided third-party information or services.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2021-07-21
